### Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Considerations:**

- The bot stores private keys (should be encrypted in production)
- Use only in secure, private chats
- Consider using API wallets instead of main wallet keys
- Test on testnet first
- Never share your private keys

## Configuration 

- Set the public key as the `account_address` in examples/config.json.
- Set your private key as the `secret_key` in examples/config.json.
- See the example of loading the config in examples/example_utils.py

### [Optional] Generate a new API key for an API Wallet
Generate and authorize a new API private key on https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/API, and set the API wallet's private key as the `secret_key` in examples/config.json. Note that you must still set the public key of the main wallet *not* the API wallet as the `account_address` in examples/config.json

## Usage Examples
```python
from hyperliquid.info import Info
from hyperliquid.utils import constants

info = Info(constants.TESTNET_API_URL, skip_ws=True)
user_state = info.user_state("0xcd5051944f780a621ee62e39e493c489668acf4d")
print(user_state)
```
See [examples](examples) for more complete examples. You can also checkout the repo and run any of the examples after configuring your private key e.g. 
```bash
cp examples/config.json.example examples/config.json
vim examples/config.json
python examples/basic_order.py
```

## Getting started with contributing to this repo

1. Download `Poetry`: https://python-poetry.org/. 
   - Note that in the install script you might have to set `symlinks=True` in `venv.EnvBuilder`.
   - Note that Poetry v2 is not supported, so you'll need to specify a specific version e.g. curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | POETRY_VERSION=1.4.1 python3 - 

2. Point poetry to correct version of python. For development we require python 3.10 exactly. Some dependencies have issues on 3.11, while older versions don't have correct typing support.
`brew install python@3.10 && poetry env use /opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.10/3.10.16/bin/python3.10`

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
make install
```

### Makefile usage

CLI commands for faster development. See `make help` for more details.

```bash
check-safety          Run safety checks on dependencies
cleanup               Cleanup project
install               Install dependencies from poetry.lock
install-types         Find and install additional types for mypy
lint                  Alias for the pre-commit target
lockfile-update       Update poetry.lock
lockfile-update-full  Fully regenerate poetry.lock
poetry-download       Download and install poetry
pre-commit            Run linters + formatters via pre-commit, run "make pre-commit hook=black" to run only black
test                  Run tests with pytest
update-dev-deps       Update development dependencies to latest versions
```

## Releases

You can see the list of available releases on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk/releases) page.

We follow the [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) specification and use [`Release Drafter`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter). As pull requests are merged, a draft release is kept up-to-date listing the changes, ready to publish when you‚Äôre ready. With the categories option, you can categorize pull requests in release notes using labels.

### List of labels and corresponding titles

|               **Label**               |  **Title in Releases**  |

### Building and releasing

Building a new version of the application contains steps:

- Bump the version of your package with `poetry version <version>`. You can pass the new version explicitly, or a rule such as `major`, `minor`, or `patch`. For more details, refer to the [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) standard.
- Make a commit to `GitHub`
- Create a `GitHub release`
- `poetry publish --build`
